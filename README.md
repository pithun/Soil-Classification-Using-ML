# Soil-Classification-Using-ML
UNN Civil Engineering Laboratory with a Team of 4 Data Scientists undertook this project of trying to use Machine Learning to classify soils based on the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS).

## Team Plan
Hi Cheta, Hello Nwigwe,

First of all well-done in getting to this final lap, it's not easy I've been there. May God continue to strengthen you guys and may He see us through this project. Amen!

Next,
1. Please find your assigned tasks in [Soil Classification - TO DO](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UvQIVmihlnxBHTTkEFEU4tSTXMYamf6IsT83p4NNGV8/edit?usp=sharing) sheet. Please keep in mind that the TO DO list is flexible and tasks can be added and Assignee can be changed. So be on the constant look out.
2. Please make a fork of this repo in your own Github accounts.
3. Some files will be added here including the codes I'll develop and all the images we'll use in modelling.
4. If you have any codes or anything developed and you want to add here, make a pull request and I'll review. If you're not comfortable with GitHub, just message me and we can proceed.
